<p class = ""><a href="https://donutsthegame.com/" class = "highlight underline" target="_blank">Donuts!</a> is an arcade racing and skateboarding game. A tribute to the Dreamcast-era arcade classics like Crazy Taxi and Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Donuts! has players making donuts by performing tricks and then racing to deliver them as quickly as they can.</p>
<p>The game follows Mony, a first-generation Cambodian-American who attempts to revitalize their family's donut business by starting a delivery service. The player must perform tricks with the food truck—ollies, flips, and the titular donut—in order to fulfil these orders and then race to the delivery point to recieve points. Try to rack up as many points as you can during a day of work! Interwoven with the high-speed, high-skill gameplay, the game tells a heartwarming story about family legacies, immigration, and the Cambodian-American experience.</p>
<p>Donuts was created as part of USC's Advanced Games Project program, our schools games capstone class. I led a team of 5 game designers to conquer our game's unique design challenges. I was the only sophomore selected as a game design lead that year.</p>
